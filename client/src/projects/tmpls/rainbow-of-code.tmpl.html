      <div class="project-summary">
        <p>An attempt to fool Github's language API (<a href="https://github.com/github/linguist" target="_blank">Linguist</a>) into thinking the project contained exactly one file written in every cataloged programming language. Github projects display how much of the repo is written in each language in a colorbar above the file list, so this script was a ploy to make it generate a rainbow. However, Github hardcodes how many segments can be displaed, so this star-crossed project has been abandoned.</p>
        <p>Also, I wrote it in Dogescript, which is even worse of a language than you think it is.</p>
