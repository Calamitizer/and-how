      <p>A minimum-viable-product prototype of a tile-sliding game, written with Pygame. Take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle" target="_blank">15 puzzle</a>, shrink it to 3 × 3, and superpose three copies of it, one each in red, green, and blue. 3 × (3² - 1) = 24. Your cursor can be set to cyan, magenta, and yellow, and clicking on a square will attempt a move in the two puzzles corresponding to the component colors of the cursor color (it's more intuitive than it sounds). Your goal is to solve all three puzzles at once.</p>
       <p>24 is a mockup for a mobile game idea, to figure out whether the game was actually <em>fun</em>. The answer is, well, sort of. There's some satisfying puzzling to be done, but A) it's tricky to clearly present multiple things happening in the same place without overloading the player, and B) even for a 2-wide version (with the enchanting name "9") it can be surprisingly difficult. There's potential, but I wasn't convinced to start building the app. It's more tempting after hearing about cross-platform tools like <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/" target="_blank">Cordova</a>, though.</p>
