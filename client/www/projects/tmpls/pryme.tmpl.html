        <p>A Python module implementing object-oriented models of various combinatorial and number-theoretic structures. The Decomposition class stores a number by its unique prime factorization. By exploiting Python's magic methods and operator overloading, Decompositions can be multiplied, divided, &amp;c., and the math happens with the sequences of exponents, not with the numbers themselves. This makes GCD and LCM computations extremely efficient, since you can just take the pairwise minimums and maximums of the exponents.</p>
