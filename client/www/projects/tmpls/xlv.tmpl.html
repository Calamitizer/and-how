        <p>A webapp that visualizes Google search volume data for various keywords pertaining to the 2016 USA presidential election and the ensuing administration. You can explore the trends of such curated searches as "president requirements", "Canadian immigration", "alternative facts", "who are my senators", "world war 3", "Donald Trump shaves Vince McMahon", and "fascism".</p>
        <p>XLV also has a catalog of relevant political events (and links to well-sourced journalism pieces about them), and presents them alongside the search profiles, to put a finger on America's pulse. Not everyone has a soapbox to shout from, but anybody can Google.</p>
        <p>Currently in early development.</p>
